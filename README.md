## Project Objective <a name="p objective"></a>
This is my first project in PyTorch. The aim of the project is to get myself familiar with the PyTorch environment and perform a simple multivariate regression using deep learning model. 

## Python Packages
1. PyTorch
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. pandas

## Acknowledgement
This project is heavily cited and supported by the free online textbook [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/). I stress that the project is for self-educating purpose and hence far from original. The goal is to practise deep learning in PyTorch and successfully deploy the work on GitHub.
